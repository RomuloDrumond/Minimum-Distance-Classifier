To install dependencies run `pip install -r requirements.txt` on the main directory.

### Important libraries used:

* Sklearn, for the easy  access to data sets and some handy functions
* Plotly, for beautiful graphs;
* Numpy, for vector and matrices computation;
* Scipy, for the fast `cdist` function;
